This project works to demostrate knowledge of JavaScript and HTML enough to produce a deliverable.
The main goal of this project is to produce a primitive "virtual chat room" akin to games like Club Penguin.
The project is very early in development, where this current version is more of a framework to produce a simple chat feed.
It is likely as this project continues there will be more implementation of various packages and APIs to become familiar with them.
Hopefully this will continuously receive updates until I am satisfied with its current state.

Things planned during the development of this project:
- pretty up via CSS [using Tailwind]
- avatars
- virtual "room" to walk around the page
- simple automatic chat moderation
- log current session activity
- web security

This program does NOT hold persistent data. This is intentional.

If you want to use this program:
- The program automatically starts on LOCALHOST [your computer only]. It is best to leave this alone
- DO NOT HOST PUBLICLY UNLESS YOU IMPLEMENT WEB SECURITY YOURSELF. THERE ARE NO SECURITY MEASURES IN PLACE IN THIS VERSION
